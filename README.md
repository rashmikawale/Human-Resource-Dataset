Business Problem: Why are your best and most experienced employees leaving prematurely? Predicting who might leave before they go could allow you to intervene earlier.

Insights of the dataset:

Income is the main factor towards employee attrition. As seen in the histogram of monthly income for salespeople with attrition and without attrition from the excel file 'Reports', the attrition rate is evidently high at very low income levels- less than 5k monthly. This decreases further- but a minor spike is noticed around 10k- indicating the middle class livelihood. They tend to shift towards a better standard of living, and hence move to a different job. When the monthly income is pretty decent, the chances of an employee leaving the organization is low- as seen by the flat trend.
